MoonActive OCR challenge: vehicle registration plate detection
by: Omri Zedan

In this project I perform vehicle registration plate detection on registration plate images in a small local dataset.
Based on the retrieved registration plate number, a decision is made as for whether the car should be permitted to enter a hypothetical parking lot. the decision alongside it's reason are then saved to relational database.

prerequisites:
	
1.	OpenCV: python package for loading images.
	docs and installation guide: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
	
2.	PostgreSQL: Relational database. Utilized for this project is Postgres.

3.	pytesseract: OCR capabilities. pytesseract is a python wrapper for Googleâ€™s Tesseract-OCR Engine.
